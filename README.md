# Object Detection in an Urban Environment

## Data

For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

[OPTIONAL] - The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records. We have already provided the data required to finish this project in the workspace, so you don't need to download it separately.

## Structure

### Data

The data you will use for training, validation and testing is organized as follow:
```
/home/workspace/data/waymo
	- training_and_validation - contains 97 files to train and validate your models
    - train: contain the train data (empty to start)
    - val: contain the val data (empty to start)
    - test - contains 3 files to test your model and create inference videos
```
The `training_and_validation` folder contains file that have been downsampled: we have selected one every 10 frames from 10 fps videos. The `testing` folder contains frames from the 10 fps video without downsampling.
```
You will split this `training_and_validation` data into `train`, and `val` sets by completing and executing the `create_splits.py` file.
```

### Experiments
The experiments folder will be organized as follow:
experiments/
    - pretrained_model/
    - exporter_main_v2.py - to create an inference model
    - model_main_tf2.py - to launch training
    - reference/ - reference training with the unchanged config file
    - experiment0/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment1/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment2/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - label_map.pbtxt
    ...

## Prerequisites

### Local Setup

For local setup if you have your own Nvidia GPU, you can use the provided Dockerfile and requirements in the [build directory](./build).

Follow [the README therein](./build/README.md) to create a docker container and install all prerequisites.

### Download and process the data

**Note:** ‚ÄùIf you are using the classroom workspace, we have already completed the steps in the section for you. You can find the downloaded and processed files within the `/home/workspace/data/preprocessed_data/` directory. Check this out then proceed to the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.

The first goal of this project is to download the data from the Waymo's Google Cloud bucket to your local machine. For this project, we only need a subset of the data provided (for example, we do not need to use the Lidar data). Therefore, we are going to download and trim immediately each file. In `download_process.py`, you can view the `create_tf_example` function, which will perform this processing. This function takes the components of a Waymo Tf record and saves them in the Tf Object Detection api format. An example of such function is described [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#create-tensorflow-records). We are already providing the `label_map.pbtxt` file.

You can run the script using the following command:
```
python download_process.py --data_dir {processed_file_location} --size {number of files you want to download}
```

You are downloading 100 files (unless you changed the `size` parameter) so be patient! Once the script is done, you can look inside your `data_dir` folder to see if the files have been downloaded and processed correctly.

### Classroom Workspace

In the classroom workspace, every library and package should already be installed in your environment. You will NOT need to make use of `gcloud` to download the images.

## Instructions

### Exploratory Data Analysis

You should use the data already present in `/home/workspace/data/waymo` directory to explore the dataset! This is the most important task of any machine learning project. To do so, open the `Exploratory Data Analysis` notebook. In this notebook, your first task will be to implement a `display_instances` function to display images and annotations using `matplotlib`. This should be very similar to the function you created during the course. Once you are done, feel free to spend more time exploring the data and report your findings. Report anything relevant about the dataset in the writeup.

Keep in mind that you should refer to this analysis to create the different spits (training, testing and validation).


### Create the training - validation splits
In the class, we talked about cross-validation and the importance of creating meaningful training and validation splits. For this project, you will have to create your own training and validation sets using the files located in `/home/workspace/data/waymo`. The `split` function in the `create_splits.py` file does the following:
* create three subfolders: `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`
* split the tf records files between these three folders by symbolically linking the files from `/home/workspace/data/waymo/` to `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`

Use the following command to run the script once your function is implemented:
```
python create_splits.py --data-dir /home/workspace/data
```

### Edit the config file

Now you are ready for training. As we explain during the course, the Tf Object Detection API relies on **config files**. The config that we will use for this project is `pipeline.config`, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. You can learn more about the Single Shot Detector [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf).

First, let's download the [pretrained model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and move it to `/home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/`.

We need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:
```
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 2 --checkpoint /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map /home/workspace/experiments/label_map.pbtxt
```
A new config file has been created, `pipeline_new.config`.

### Training

You will now launch your very first experiment with the Tensorflow object detection API. Move the `pipeline_new.config` to the `/home/workspace/experiments/reference` folder. Now launch the training process:
* a training process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config
```
Once the training is finished, launch the evaluation process:
* an evaluation process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=experiments/reference/
```

**Note**: Both processes will display some Tensorflow warnings, which can be ignored. You may have to kill the evaluation script manually using
`CTRL+C`.

To monitor the training, you can launch a tensorboard instance by running `python -m tensorboard.main --logdir experiments/reference/`. You will report your findings in the writeup.

### Improve the performances

Most likely, this initial experiment did not yield optimal results. However, you can make multiple changes to the config file to improve this model. One obvious change consists in improving the data augmentation strategy. The [`preprocessor.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/preprocessor.proto) file contains the different data augmentation method available in the Tf Object Detection API. To help you visualize these augmentations, we are providing a notebook: `Explore augmentations.ipynb`. Using this notebook, try different data augmentation combinations and select the one you think is optimal for our dataset. Justify your choices in the writeup.

Keep in mind that the following are also available:
* experiment with the optimizer: type of optimizer, learning rate, scheduler etc
* experiment with the architecture. The Tf Object Detection API [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) offers many architectures. Keep in mind that the `pipeline.config` file is unique for each architecture and you will have to edit it.

**Important:** If you are working on the workspace, your storage is limited. You may to delete the checkpoints files after each experiment. You should however keep the `tf.events` files located in the `train` and `eval` folder of your experiments. You can also keep the `saved_model` folder to create your videos.


### Creating an animation
#### Export the trained model
Modify the arguments of the following function to adjust it to your models:

```
python experiments/exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --trained_checkpoint_dir experiments/reference/ --output_directory experiments/reference/exported/
```

This should create a new folder `experiments/reference/exported/saved_model`. You can read more about the Tensorflow SavedModel format [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model).

Finally, you can create a video of your model's inferences for any tf record file. To do so, run the following command (modify it to your files):
```
python inference_video.py --labelmap_path label_map.pbtxt --model_path experiments/reference/exported/saved_model --tf_record_path /data/waymo/testing/segment-12200383401366682847_2552_140_2572_140_with_camera_labels.tfrecord --config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation.gif
```

### <span style="color:red">Project overview</span>
In this project, we will be using data from the Waymo Open dataset for Object Detection. We have already provided with the data required to finish this project in the workspace, so don't need to download it separately. TF Object detction APIs are used for objection detecion with available classes - car, cycles and pedestrians. In this project we first train and evaluate the image data set. After that we analyse the model performance and later improve the model perfomance by data augmentation technique.











### <span style="color:red">Set up</span>
Using the Udacity classroom student workspace, not using any local setup.

### <span style="color:red">Dataset</span>

Step 1 - 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data already present in /home/workspace/data/ directory to explore the dataset. Here we update the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook is display 10 images with boundary boxes (display_images function is updated in the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook.). Classes are color coded (vehicles in red, pedestrians in green, cyclist in blue).

Below shows example of one of the displayed image with boundary boxes.

#### <span style="color:red">Dataset analysis</span>

Observation 1:

Noticed some of the images are taken during different lighting conditions. Example below taken during night time.

![!](images/1.PNG)

Observation 2:


Observed in 10 random samples, most of the labels are pointed to cars when compared to pedestrians and bicycles. And number associated to cyclists is vey small. This is noticed even after repeated executions for random dataset. This is not good for training as we should have balanced dataset for all labels under consideration. 


### <span style="color:red">Training & Evaluation</span>

Have used create_splits.py file split the data into training and validation by picking it from workspace\data\waymo\training_and_validation. Here percentage of training data used is 80% and remaining 20% used for evaluation data.

Note : Training dataset is placed inside workspace\data\train  and evaluation dataset is placed inside workspace\data\eval


#### <span style="color:red">Reference experiment</span>
config file pipeline.config is used for the SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model configuration. Pretrained model is placed in the below path.


 /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/

 Below command is executed to generate the pipeline_new.config

cd /home/workspace/
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 2 --checkpoint /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map /home/workspace/experiments/label_map.pbtxt

New pipeline config file generated to perform training is moved inside /home/workspace/experiments/reference/ directory


Below commands are executed to launch the image data set for training and evaluation.

Training:
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config

Evaulation:
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=experiments/reference/

Note : For training and evaluation, we use  experiments/reference/ folder.


#### <span style="color:red">Cross validation</span>

Tensorboard instance is launched by running below command to monitor the training and evaluation performance.

python -m tensorboard.main --logdir experiments/reference/

The training loss is indicated in orange and the validation loss in blue.

![!](images/tensor_board_before_augmentation.PNG)
![!](images/Precision_Recall_before_augmentation.PNG)

We observe training loss diverges at certian points and begins to overfit at that points. 

#### <span style="color:red">Improve on the reference

Experimental results showed that classification with grayscale images resulted in higher accuracy classification than with RGB images. Images can be suitaby augented with gray scale (For example, I would like to add a random RGB to gray transform with a probability of 0.3). During training we havce noticed loss function values are bit higher. One of the reason for this is some of the images considered for training ae taken during night time. This issue can be addressed by augmenting the images by decreasing the brightness of images which will mimic the night conditions. Augmentations are added in the pipeline config file. And to visualize these augmentations, Explore augmentations.ipynb file is updated. 

Updated pipeline_new.config file is placed inside /home/workspace/experiments/solution/ directory

Below shows example of augmented image with RGB to gray transform with a probability of 0.3.

![!](images/image_after_augmentation_with_gray.PNG)

After performing augmentation, we run the training and evaluation on augmented data. We see model performance improves after augmentation as shown in the below graphs.

Note : For training and evaluation, we use  experiments/solution/ folder.
